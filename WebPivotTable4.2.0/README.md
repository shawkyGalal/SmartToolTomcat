data, create reports. It is also the major client side tool within Microsoft Business
Intelligence solution to pivot Microsoft Analysis Service (SSAS) cubes interactively.

one of the most underutilized tools in the entire Microsoft Office Suite since 
it is not intuitive enough to be used by normal users and hard to be integrated 
into other applications by professional developers.

interface. There are almost no learn curves for normal users. Users can create an
analysis report in minutes with a lot of customize options. WPT is a great 
choice for any users to analysis their data easily and powerfully.

at local drive, or at a cloud drive or an Internet link. The data format can be 
any of the most popular formats, like CSV, XLS, XLSX and Google spreadsheet.
