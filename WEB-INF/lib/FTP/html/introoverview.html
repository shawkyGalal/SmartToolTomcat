FTP Factory is a set of Java based client components for exchanging data
between machines. Including FTP (File Transfer Protocol), FTPS (FTP over
SSL) and SFTP (FTP over SSH) components, developers will appreciate the
easy-to-use API making it possible to exchange data using just a few
lines of code. <br>

<br>
The FTP component offers complete FTP functionality including the
ability to transfer files, rename files, delete files, create
directories, transfer directories recursively and more. The FTPS (FTP
over SSL) component offers all the features found in the FTP component
with the added ability to encrypt FTP data using SSL (Secure Sockets
Layer). The FTPS (FTP over SSH) component offers all the features found
in the FTP component with the added ability to secure all data
transferred using a secure SSH2 channel. Using the FTPS or SFTP
components you can be assured your data is protected as it travels over
the Internet. <br>

<br>
In addition to the FTP, FTPS and SFTP components Secure FTP Factory
provides a file transfer scripting component named FTCL (File Transfer
Command Line). This component allows you to write and execute scripts to
perform FTP, FTPS and SFTP operations using nothing but a simple text
editor and your operating system command line. <br>

<br>
<b>Target audience</b> <br>

<br>
This document is intended to serve as a technical guide to using the
classes found in Secure FTP Factory. Users should understand the
Java&#153; programming language and be proficient in writing Java&#153;
applications. <br>
